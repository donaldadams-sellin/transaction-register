# Getting Started
 You can access the app [here](https://transactionregister.herokuapp.com/) and find the planning trello board [here](https://trello.com/b/O5qtGagw/project-2-planning).

 # Next Steps
 As the purpose of the app is straightforward, I  would say the main areas to improve it would be in presentation as it is a bit simple looking at the moment.
